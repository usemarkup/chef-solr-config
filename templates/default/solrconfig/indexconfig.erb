         using fewer file descriptors on the expense of performance decrease. 
         Default in Lucene is "true". Default in Solr is "false" (since 3.6) -->
    <!-- <useCompoundFile>false</useCompoundFile> -->

    <!-- ramBufferSizeMB sets the amount of RAM that may be used by Lucene
         indexing for buffering added documents and deletions before they are
         flushed to the Directory.
         maxBufferedDocs sets a limit on the number of documents buffered
         before flushing.
         If both ramBufferSizeMB and maxBufferedDocs is set, then
         Lucene will flush based on whichever limit is hit first.
         The default is 100 MB.  -->

    <!-- Expert: Merge Policy 
         The Merge Policy in Lucene controls how merging of segments is done.
         The default since Solr/Lucene 3.3 is TieredMergePolicy.
         The default since Lucene 2.3 was the LogByteSizeMergePolicy,
         Even older versions of Lucene used LogDocMergePolicy.
      -->

    <!-- Merge Factor
         The merge factor controls how many segments will get merged at a time.
         For TieredMergePolicy, mergeFactor is a convenience parameter which
         will set both MaxMergeAtOnce and SegmentsPerTier at once.
         For LogByteSizeMergePolicy, mergeFactor decides how many new segments
         will be allowed before they are merged into one.
         Default is 10 for both merge policies.

    <!-- 
    <mergeFactor>10</mergeFactor>

    <!-- Expert: Merge Scheduler
         The Merge Scheduler in Lucene controls how merges are
         performed.  The ConcurrentMergeScheduler (Lucene 2.3 default)
         can perform merges in the background using separate threads.
         The SerialMergeScheduler (Lucene 2.2 default) does not.

    <!-- LockFactory 

         This option specifies which Lucene LockFactory implementation
         to use.
      
         single = SingleInstanceLockFactory - suggested for a
                  read-only index or when there is no possibility of
                  another process trying to modify the index.
         native = NativeFSLockFactory - uses OS native file locking.
                  Do not use when multiple solr webapps in the same
                  JVM are attempting to share a single index.
         simple = SimpleFSLockFactory  - uses a plain file for locking

         Defaults: 'native' is default for Solr3.6 and later, otherwise
                   'simple' is the default

         More details on the nuances of each LockFactory...

    <lockType>${solr.lock.type:native}</lockType>

    <!-- Commit Deletion Policy
         Custom deletion policies can be specified here. The class must
         implement org.apache.lucene.index.IndexDeletionPolicy.

         The default Solr IndexDeletionPolicy implementation supports
         deleting index commit points on number of commits, age of
         commit point and optimized status.
         
         The latest commit point should always be preserved regardless
         of the criteria.
    -->
    <!-- 
    <deletionPolicy class="solr.SolrDeletionPolicy">
    -->
      <!-- The number of commit points to be kept -->
      <!-- <str name="maxCommitsToKeep">1</str> -->
      <!-- The number of optimized commit points to be kept -->
      <!-- <str name="maxOptimizedCommitsToKeep">0</str> -->
      <!--
          Delete all commit points once they have reached the given age.
          Supports DateMathParser syntax e.g.
        -->
      <!--

    <!-- Lucene Infostream
       
         To aid in advanced debugging, Lucene provides an "InfoStream"
         of detailed information when indexing.

         Setting the value to true will instruct the underlying Lucene
         IndexWriter to write its info stream to solr's log. By default,
         this is enabled here, and controlled through log4j.properties.
      -->
